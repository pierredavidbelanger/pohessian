============

PoHessian (http://code.google.com/p/pohessian/) is a portable 
(thanks to Poco (http://pocoproject.org/)) C++ Hessian 
(http://hessian.caucho.com/) implementation.

See the http://code.google.com/p/pohessian/wiki/GettingStarted page 
to learn how to begin. Or read the included generic INSTALL file.

In addition to the generic configure switchs, you can use:

  --with-poco-foundation-include=DIR
                          Poco Foundation include directory
  --with-poco-net-include=DIR
                          Poco Net include directory
  --with-poco-lib=DIR     Poco lib directory


For any kind of bug or request (for enhancement, documentation) 
or general question that can benefit someone else, 
please create an issue (http://code.google.com/p/pohessian/issues/entry). 
For everything else contact me (pierredavidbelanger@gmail.com).
